    - but I spend around 1h of reading documentatiot and try figure out how to auto open video in full screen
        what is no possible. Or maybe there is a hack with hammer, but I dont waht to do that
    - in documentation for elemnt.requestFullScreen() https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/requestFullScreen        
        we can find that only user can trigger this event
